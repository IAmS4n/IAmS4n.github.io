  My name is Ehsan Montahaei.
  I hold an M.Sc. degree in Artificial intelligence from the Sharif University of Technology.
  I have been working as a researcher in the Machine Learning Lab at the Sharif University of Technology since I graduated.
  My research interest is **Machine Learning**, especially **Deep Learning**.
  My master thesis was about the **generative models** and usage of adversarial training for **sequence generation**.
  Currently, I am working on **Computer Vision** with application in **Gigapixel Histopathology** images.
  Also, I have some experiences in multidisciplinary research including usage of **GANs** in cosmology for Cosmic String simulation, and working on different segmentation and classification tasks of **3D images** such as CT and MRI.

  I am fascinated by automation and the practical use of AI in real life.
  The application of theory for **practical solutions** is the most interesting part of the research for me.
  Dealing with challenges and solving problems is one of my main interests, and I have experienced in different competitions which are mentioned below.
