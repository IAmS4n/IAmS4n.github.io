    The subject of my research is **"Cancer in Histopathologic Images"**.
    I was in the middle of doing my research when the world faced COVID-19 pandemic and Iran suffered from a widespread of this virus as well.
    Among tireless efforts of different researchers about COVID-19, I was asked to join in a project about researching and developing tools over **CT images** that were used for diagnosis of involvement.
    This made a temporary change in accomplishing my main research.
    But I had the opportunity to broaden my knowledge about medical images and use it to continue my research.

    The learning phase of the internship was about the parallelization technique in computers. My focus was on CPU parallelization and learning of related libraries and techniques in C++. Also, I experienced a deeper understanding of compilers for improving performance.

    After the learning phase, my primary task was research on finding a high-speed solution for Dynamic Skyline Problem under the supervision of Dr.&nbsp;Saeid Gorgin. I utilized my algorithm and data structure experience plus the learned technique for doing my task successfully by winning the prize of an international contest.
