    The learning phase of the internship was about the parallelization technique in computers. My focus was on CPU parallelization and learning of related libraries and techniques in C++. Also, I experienced a deeper understanding of compilers for improving performance.

    After the learning phase, my primary task was research on finding a high-speed solution for Dynamic Skyline Problem under the supervision of Dr.&nbsp;Saeid Gorgin. I utilized my algorithm and data structure experience plus the learned technique for doing my task successfully by winning the prize of an international contest.
