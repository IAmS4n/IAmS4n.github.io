  description: |
    Different ML models are tested on the EEG signal to recognize some humans' actions from their brains.
    Features extracted from the frequency spectrogram and it turns out Random Forest is the best model.
    The implementation utilizes **Scikit-Learn**.

- name: Vision-based 360-degree Robot
  youtube_video: ZQ_D5UqUvxY
  description: |
    Design and construction of a mobile robot with the ability to move to specific points on a board.

    I used machine vision (**OpenCV** library) for navigation, Bluetooth technology for communication, and **OpenMP** library for enhancing the performance of the routing algorithms.
    The programming language that is used in this project was **C++**.

    As you can see in the left video, there is a fixed camera above the robot.
    The camera is connected to a computer and the position and angle of the robot are detected based on the robot's marker pattern.
    The computer wirelessly sends commands which describe the PWM rate and working time for each of four motors.
    the robot utilizes an **AVR microcontroller** for the execution of these commands.

- name: Privacy-focused DICOM web panel
  github: IAmS4n/CTLabeling
  image: /images/ct_panel_demo.png
  description: |
    The web system is developed based on **Flask framework** for the easy labeling of DICOM images with Privacy protection.
    The system is used for connecting to an AI system.
    Also, the system is prepared for use in an **Active Learning scenario**.

- name: English With Movie
  image: /images/lang.png
  description: |
    A web-based video player to utilize movies for practicing language skills.
    The player gets a movie with two language subtitles, then it plays video dialog by dialog with an automatic pause and shows two subtitles simultaneously.
    It has some combinations of different modes for practicing different skills.
    The listening part is based on hiding the subtitles and normal play of the video.
    The speaking part is based on showing just subtitle that is related to native language and muting the video.
    **JavaScript** is the language that I used for the interface and **python** for the backend.


- name: Ink Saver

  description: |
    A tool to simplify slides and document images for saving the ink of the printers.
    **OpenCV** and **Scikit-Image** libraries are utilized for image processing and **Flask framework** for the interface.
    I solve the problem of slides' background by considering slides as a video and using the video background removal techniques.

- name: Dynamic Skyline Problem
  image: /images/skyline.png
  description: |
    Design and implementation of a high-performance and distributed solution to the Dynamic Skyline Problem.
    The most important part of the implementation is using **data structures** such as the RedBlack tree.
    The implementation utilizes **C++** ans **OpenMP** library.
    Also, the problem was the challenge of an international competition (MEMOCODE 2015) and second place was achieved.

- name: MIPS CPU with Pipeline
