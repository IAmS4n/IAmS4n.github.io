  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    My thesis explored the GANs usage in text generation.
    I found some shortage in one of the common evaluation scenarios, and a new metric was introduced for enhancement of evaluation.
    Also, a new method supporting theoretical analysis was introduced, which were comparable to the state of the art methods.

    The thesis(in Persian) and related publications are in [this repository](https://github.com/IAmS4n/My-Msc-Thesis)
